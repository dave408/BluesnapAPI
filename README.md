A Demo on how to place API call on Bluesnap web server
<br>
Bluesnap is an online payment processor as well as my employer :)<br>
The PHP code examples implement the following web-services:<br>
1. create and update shopper entities<br>
2. place orders<br>
3. manage subscriptions<br>
4. use a token in order to "log a customer into" your Buy-Page<br>
5. Implementations of all kind of Bluesnap-API tools<br>
6. and more...

It is recommended to start with reading the Web-Services section in Bluesnap documentation center: http://www.bluesnap.com/helpcenter/Static/default.htm
